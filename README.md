### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I deeply enjoy coding, started in high school with an internship around 2001 and thanks to this never-stopping industry every year seems like a new beginning with interesting languages and paradigms.

I don't enjoy selling myself, after all these year I can't get over the impostor's syndrome, still finding myself learning from the experience of other seniors or even from the fresh perspective of a junior dev; Every team member is a new bridge of opportunities for learning.

Running Kaizen Interactive in Latin America for almost 7 years gave me a lot of experience dealing with freelance developers and designers and the confidence to meet clients, coming up with creative new projects, juggling with budget, deadlines and features, not forgetting the tech side I was keeping the infrastructure tunned, drafting useful reports and struggling with database performance thanks to those useful reports.

Until this moment I was deep into Marketing, Social media and advertising but that changed once I arrived in Hong Kong in 2012, closer to the mainland I could appreciate the wonder of manufacturing, and with a more demanding environment I got a push to pivot to IoT and backend programming, integrating a variety of vendors, processing big amounts of data and keep afloat high availability infrastructures.

Finally to unplug myself and recharge from everyday work I like to treat myself with some woodworking session making toys and furniture for my family and specially my son.

Plans for the future?

Space is a growing market from infrastructure, communication, embedded system, security, reliability, I'm exploring future opportunities, and here down to earth IoT still expanding, smart building and even smart cities.
